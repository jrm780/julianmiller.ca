Part 3 in a series about object oriented programming (OOP) in C++. This video covers the basic information regarding abstraction and inheritance, which are arguably the most important aspects of object oriented programming. The idea of abstraction is to use a more general, or higher-level, definition of a class or function. We can then inherit attributes and methods from the general case, in order to create more specialized classes, without needing to redefine the attributes already specified in the base class.
