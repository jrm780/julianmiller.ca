Part 4 in a series about object oriented programming (OOP) in C++. The word polymorph literally means “many forms”. In software development, polymorphism allows us to use a common interface to perform different tasks. This means we can dynamically (i.e. at runtime through user input, files, etc.) change what our code does, without using large numbers of ‘if’ statements.
